Chatterbox MVP (Chatterbox Revisit)
===================================

Project Requirements 
--------------------

You will be building a full stack chat application, from the ground up, with no boilerplate code provided.

The MVP for this project is to create a full stack app where a client can access a global chat room and chat with other clients that are utilizing the app.

I recommend wireframing the basic views to help you get started, though it is not required.

[ ] Use any front-end framework to render a global chat room on the client-side.

[ ] Use node.js (and express, if you’d like,) to provide a back-end data service to your front-end client app

[ ] Create a RESTful API or utilize Websockets to power the client--to-server interaction

[ ] Persist the messages with a database (and ORM, if you’d like,) of your choice

[ ] Style the app so it is not just black text on a page (and add styling as you go for the client-side features below)

[ ] Implement Authentication so that a user must be signed in in order to participate in the chat

[ ] Protect your HTTP/WebSocket API endpoints such that only authenticated users may add and receive chat messages

[ ] Add developer documentation to your app so that another developer can fork and work on your project
